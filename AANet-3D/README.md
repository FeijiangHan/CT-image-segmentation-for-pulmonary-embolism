# Data Preparation

1. Vessel and lung masks are provided in:
   AANet/PEData/CAD_PE_data/vessel and AANet/PEData/CAD_PE_data/lung
   Filenames correspond to CT scan IDs (e.g. 001.nii.gz). Feel free to use for your research with citation.
2. Download the CAD-PE dataset from [https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/cad-pe â†—](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/cad-pe)
   Place the CTPA scans (e.g. 001.nrrd) in 'AANet/PEData/CAD_PE_data/image'
   Place the PE labels (e.g. 001RefStd.nrrd) in 'AANet/PEData/CAD_PE_data/label'
3. Run nifty_preprocess.py to crop the lung ROI and downsample for faster training.
   Preprocessed data will be saved to './PEData/processed_itk'.

# Training and Inference

Run train_aanet.py to train the model. Use --unique_name to specify an ID. Inference is automatically run after training completes and saves results to 'AANet/pred_itk/unique_name_sth50'.

We recommend training with different random seeds, since the CAD-PE evaluation protocol can be sensitive to minor segmentation variations.

# Evaluation

Run evaluation.py and update pred_root (line 279) to your result directory for FROC curve calculation.


# Medical Image Segmentation Model Training

This code implements training and evaluation of a convolutional neural network model for segmenting lungs in CT scans.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is AANet, which contains encoding and decoding blocks with skip connections. Batch normalization is synchronized across GPUs.

## Training Pipeline

- Loads lung CT scans and segmentation masks as training data

- Applies data augmentation like random cropping, flipping, rotation 

- Defines AANet model, Dice + Tversky loss, AdamW optimizer

- Training loop with forward/backward passes, optimization, learning rate scheduling

- Evaluates validation metrics like F1 score 

- Logs training metrics, validation metrics using TensorBoard

- Saves model checkpoints during training

- Tests trained model on test set and generates lung segmentation

## Usage

Train model:

`python train.py --epochs 500 --batch_size 8` 

Main arguments:

- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `--batch_size`: Batch size
- `--learn_rate`: Learning rate 
- `--log_path`: TensorBoard log directory

The code supports multi-GPU training via PyTorch DataParallel.

## Output

- Trained model checkpoints saved to `save_models/`
- TensorBoard logs written to `log_path`
- Segmentation results on test set stored as PNGs

The code provides a configurable training framework for medical image segmentation models.
